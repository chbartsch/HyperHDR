## About 

Open source ambient lighting implementation for television sets based on the video and audio streams analysis, using performance improvements especially for USB grabbers. Single and multi-threaded video processing optimization for **Windows**, **macOS** and **Linux x64 & ARM** (Raspberry Pi and others) for SDR/HDR streams captured by USB grabbers using pre-calculated LUT tables. Direct support for USB grabbers under Windows 10 (Microsoft Media Foundation), Linux (v4l2) and macOS (AVFoundation). Also software screen grabbers are available now :new:

## Download packages & sources

Official releases: \
https://github.com/awawa-dev/HyperHDR/releases

Latest testing installers can be find as the artifacts of the latest build in the Github Action tab at the bottom of the page. Must be logged in. \
https://github.com/awawa-dev/HyperHDR/actions

Default LUT table is already included (in the installers) but you can generate your own or import 3dl Autodesk lut table.\
For Raspberry Pi you may use prepared SD card images: [manual](https://hyperhdr.blogspot.com/2020/11/hyperhdr-prepare-for-building-buying_17.html)\
Default hostname for SD images is HyperHDR so connect to http://hyperhdr:8090/ \
SSH and SPI are enabled on default.

## Main features of HyperHDR:

* **Really low CPU** usage on SoCs like Raspberry Pi using v4l2 grabbers
* Support for multithreading that makes Raspberry Pi capable of processing HQ video stream (Rpi 1 & Zero should also benefit from the optimization alone)

### Dedicated HDR LUT tables for USB grabbers

You can create your own calibrated LUT table using latest HyperHDR or use LUT dedicated for MS2109 clones, Navy U3, Ezcap 320, Ezcap 321, Ezcap 331, AV Access 4KVC00 (you can find them in the HyperHDR [release](https://github.com/awawa-dev/HyperHDR/releases/latest) section). Why is it worth using them? [USB grabbers HDR to SDR quality review](https://www.hyperhdr.eu/2022/04/usb-grabbers-hdr-to-sdr-quality-test.html)

### FAQ:

**You don't need to use an HDR source to use HyperHDR. You can just benefit from: high performance & optimized video proccessing, capability of using multithreading to avoid bottleneck resources, support for modern USB grabbers under Windows 10/Linux/macOS, decicated fast USB LED drivers (HyperSerialEsp8266, HyperSerialESP32 and HyperSerialWLED) or SPI driver (HyperSPI), screen grabbers including DirectX11 with HDR tone mapping, easy to use JSON API (both POST and GET), easy to setup automatic video signal detection, music capabilities and anti-flickering filter for best movie experience.**

Use linux 'top' command with per core view (press 1) or preferable 'htop'. On Rpi 2/3/4 max limit is 400% (4 cores per 100%). **The problem will occure when one of the core's usage is close to the 100% limit, not when overall usage is for example between 200-300% where each core if far from the individual limit.**

Thanks to our colleague @mjoshd there is a HyperHDR integration plugin for Home Assistant. Check the details on the website of the project [https://github.com/mjoshd/hyperhdr-ha](https://github.com/mjoshd/hyperhdr-ha) Also you can test a HA plugin to install HyperHDR [link](https://github.com/ihrapsa/hassio-addons) (thanks @ihrapsa) ðŸš€ ðŸ†•    
  
We do not support driving WS281x and especially SK6812 LED strips directly from the Raspberry Pi although it's theoretically possible: [link](https://github.com/awawa-dev/HyperHDR/discussions/111). If you made it and it works, fine, but most of our users weren't so lucky. You should use external ESP8266/ESP32 (preferable with CH340G or CP2104 onboard) and the voltage level shifter. :warning:  

Usage of WS281x LED strip with Rpi directly (PWM mode) requires _root_ privilages. Otherwise you may get _'Error message: mmap() failed'_ ([read more](https://github.com/awawa-dev/HyperHDR/issues/52)) :warning:

It's possible to switch off/on HDR tone mapping remotely with your home automation system. You can build commands for HyperHDR using our JSON API playground :new:
  
  
**Before and after HyperHDR LUT correction on HDR/BT2020 video that was broken by the USB grabber.\
Without it your ambient lighting colors will be washed-out:**
